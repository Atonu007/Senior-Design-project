# Senior-Design-project
I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive AI-driven healthcare solution in Java, featuring an innovative AI doctor for primary treatment. The platform seamlessly facilitates users in finding doctors, hospitals, and the nearest pharmacies, enhancing accessibility to essential healthcare resources. To optimize data communication, I implemented a custom Graph-QL API, while MySQL was leveraged for efficient and structured data storage. My active role in version control using Git ensured a smooth and collaborative development process, contributing to the overall success of the project.
